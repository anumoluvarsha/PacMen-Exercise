# PacMen Exercise
In this project, the objectives were : 1) To create pacmen when a button is clicked and 2) To Move these pacmen across the window on the click of another button.

How to run
Clone this repository on to the local system and then run it through VS Code.

Future Improvements
Right now, the code creates panmen and moves them accross the window.
